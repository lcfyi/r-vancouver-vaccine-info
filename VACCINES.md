* **Step 2: Book an appointment (18+ of age or born 2003 or earlier). You will be contacted to book a vaccine appointment when you are eligible based on your age and BC's** [**Immunization Plan phases**](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/covid-19/vaccine/plan#general-population)**.**Â 
* **Step 3: Visit the vaccine clinic to get your first vaccine dose.**
