* **Step 3: Visit the vaccine clinic to get your first vaccine dose.**

a LOT of new vaccine spots just opened up for next week, as early as June 19 for both VCH and FH. I just rescheduled a family member 2 weeks ahead, multiple people rescheduled their appt by 3-4 weeks already.

If you hunt for cancellations, you might be able to find an appointment same day or next day (just need to be flexible with time and location)
