# BC's 3 step program to get vaccinated ([Source](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/getvaccinated.html))

* **Step 1: Register 12+ (2009 or earlier). First you register when you are eligible and get a confirmation number. You will need that number to book your vaccine appointment**
* **Step 2: Book an appointment (12+ of age or born 2009 or earlier). You will be contacted to book a vaccine appointment when you are eligible based on your age and BC's** [**Immunization Plan phases**](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/covid-19/vaccine/plan#general-population)**.**Â 
* **Step 3: Visit the vaccine clinic to get your first vaccine dose.**
* **Step 4: BC is administering second doses at about 8 weeks now.  You will get notification through your email or text message about when it is your time to book.  They are currently booking those that got their first dose before April**

a LOT of new vaccine spots just opened up for next week, as early as June 19 for both VCH and FH. I just rescheduled a family member 2 weeks ahead, multiple people rescheduled their appt by 3-4 weeks already.

If you hunt for cancellations, you might be able to find an appointment same day or next day (just need to be flexible with time and location)
